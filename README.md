# 2023-Winter-Internship
This repository contains code developed during my Winter 2023 Internship at Bechtel for a data science project. The code is implemented in Python, leveraging libraries such as pandas, GENSIM, NLTK, and others.

Please note that certain files, such as the dataset and saved files, are not included due to restrictions on public distribution as per Bechtel's policies.

For detailed information about the project requirements, refer to the file titled 'Sprinternship Challenge Project'.
